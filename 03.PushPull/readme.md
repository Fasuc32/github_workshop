# Here we'll learn about what makes github repos so useful, the ability to backup data and move seamlessly between workstations
---
Well, we've made a repo, but what can we *do* with it? 

Quite a bit, as it turns out! Imagine that you just got a new laptop, and a new office computer. Awesome, right? Must be nice. **BUT** now you have to get all of your work onto 2 PC's. Annoying. 

With github though, it's very easy! 

The first step is to clone your repository onto your laptop. 

Open up Github desktop. If you click on the top left box under the file menu, it will show you all of your cloned repos. Yours will likely be blank, but that's ok!

---

Next, click on the add button, and a drop down will open, click on the 'clone repository' option, you'll then see the repositories you have access to. Click on the one that you made, and set a local path for the folders and files to download to. I keep all my repos in a 'Git' folder, for easy keeping. Then, hit the clone button!

---

It will download your repo to your local PC. Awesome right, now all of your files and code are right there. 

Now, Github desktop should show your repository name, and you'll see a lot of empty, because it's fully updated.

We work on our computers though, not on github itself, generally speaking. So, let's upload some data. Open up the space on your local machine where you made the repo, and go to the repo file. Make a new folder

---

Now, in that folder, upload some data. Or just make an empty word document like I did, whatever.

---

Now open github desktop back up. Click that fetch origin box in the top right. That checks your local folder with the online repo. It looks like it saw that we have a new folder and a new document on our local machine that isn't on our online repo.

---

We'll want to make sure that's backed up, so on the bottom left, enter a commit message for the change that you made, then hit 'commit to main'

![Github Desktop](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.7.jpg?raw=true)

---

Ok, you've made the commit, ***but, and this is a very big but, it's not backed up online yet*** 

You'll have to click 'push origin' to push your changes to your online repo. Do that now

---

It'll upload your data, and then you should see this, which just means your local files are up to date with your repo

---

Now, go back online, looking at github on your browser. You should see the new folder where you uploaded data, the commit message you entered, and then the time you did it

![Github Desktop](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.10.jpg?raw=true)

---

Click on the folder, and there's your data

![Github Desktop](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.11.jpg?raw=true)

---

If this seems exceedingly simple, that's because ***it is***. Which is great, because it makes keeping all of your files AND the history of your work very simple. 

Integrate this into your daily workflow, and you'll find transferring between workstations to be exceedingly easy, and you can even go back to your commit messages and see what you did, and why.
