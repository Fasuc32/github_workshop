# It's time to make your own repo!

Ok, let's start by making a very basic, introductory repo together. You can use this template for your own repos later on!

First, let's start by making a repo, and creating our first folder, file, and commit in it!

Click on the green 'new' button in the top left of your screen.

---

This should open up a window for creating your very own repository! It should look like this, and you'll need to enter a name for it. You can also add a description, choose whether it's public or private, and add a README file (you'll notice this is a recurring theme). Type in a name

Ok great! You did it, you should see this now, with the repo name after your username in the rop left, and the readme markdown file being the only file.

Ok, hit that little pen to the far right of the README.md file, that should open up the ability to code it in the markdown syntax. Here I wrote a little note, and then updated the header under 'commit changes'

---

Now, if I want to see the main repo, back from the folder I created, I click on the name of the folder

---

You should see someting like this, which shows your latest update to the readme.md file, and what it contains

---

Ok, let's add a another folder to this repo! Click on the 'add file button'

![Adding a folder](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/repo.creation.7.jpg?raw=true)****

---

You should now see the name of the repo, followed by a '/' with an empty text box for naming your file or folder

---

Ok, we don't want to just add a file, we want to create a new folder! So, type in the name of your folder. I was boring and just made it 'folder'. ***Don't hit enter***

---

This is where the **magic** happens! Ok, after your folder name, put in a backslash (/) and then another text box will appear, and here you'll enter readme.md to make a readme file for your new folder

---

Ok, don't hit enter just yet! Put some text into the read me file, and then look at the bottom, with the 'commit new file' option. In this text box, just put a little note saying what you did, then hit enter.

---

Now, click on the name of your repo

![Coding the readme](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/repo.creation.12.jpg?raw=true)

---

You should now see your new folder, and its contents, along with the message you put for the commit!

**That's pretty much it!** You've made a repo, and added a folder into it!
