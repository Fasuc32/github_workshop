# Well, what else can you do with a repo?
That was great! We made a repo, cloned it, made changes on our local pc and pushed them to the github cloud, and even compartmentalized some R code for easy downstream work. 
But guess what, there's even *more* we can do!

## Alternate timelines

One of the coolest things you can do is create alternate [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) within your repo, to do things like test out new methods without changing the original branch. 

## Integrating with apps

You can have github directly in R, Visual Studio Code, TeXstudio, and other programs. That's a bit outside of the scope of this workshop, but it's possible!
